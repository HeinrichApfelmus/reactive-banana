Reactive-banana is a library for functional reactive programming (FRP).  FRP
offers an elegant and concise way to express interactive programs such as
graphical user interfaces, animations, computer music or robot controllers.
It promises to avoid the spaghetti code that is all too common in traditional
approaches to GUI programming.

The goal of the library is to provide a solid foundation.

\begin{compactitem}
\item Programmers interested in implementing FRP will have a \emph{reference}
  for a \emph{simple semantics} with a working implementation. The library
  stays close to the semantics pioneered by Conal Elliott.
\item The library features an \emph{efficient implementation}. No more spooky
  time leaks, predicting space \& time usage should be straightforward.
\end{compactitem}

The library is meant to be used in conjunction with existing libraries that
are specific to your problem domain. For instance, you can hook it into any
event-based GUI framework, like wxHaskell or Gtk2Hs. Several helper packages
like reactive-banana-wx provide a small amount of glue code that can make life
easier.

\subsubsection*{Status}

The latest release is version \verb`1.1.0.1`. Thanks to
the efforts of our co-maintainer Oliver Charles, the library is available on Stackage.~\cref{stackage} The library API is stable and feature complete.

\subsubsection*{Future development}

There still remains some work to be done to improve the constant factor performance of the library. Also, the library does not yet compile well to JavaScript with GHC/JS, as there are some issues with garbage collection.

Several other improvements have been suggested on the issue tracker, most notably renaming the \verb`Event` type to \verb`Events`, as the plural provides a more apt description of the semantics of this type.
