    Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------}
{-$intro1

At its core, Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is about two
data types 'Event' and 'Behavior' and the various ways to combine them.

-}

-- Event
-- Behavior

{-$intro2

As you can see, both types seem to have a superfluous parameter @t@.
The library uses it to rule out certain gross inefficiencies,
in particular in connection with dynamic event switching.
For basic stuff, you can completely ignore it,
except of course for the fact that it will annoy you in your type signatures.

While the type synonyms mentioned above are the way you should think about
'Behavior' and 'Event', they are a bit vague for formal manipulation.
To remedy this, the library provides a very simple but authoritative
model implementation. See "Reactive.Banana.Model" for more.

> instance Applicative (Behavior t)

'Behavior' is an applicative functor. In particular, we have the following functions.

> pure :: a -> Behavior t a

The constant time-varying value. Think of it as @pure x = \\time -> x@.

> (<*>) :: Behavior t (a -> b) -> Behavior t a -> Behavior t b

Combine behaviors in applicative style.
Think of it as @bf \<*\> bx = \\time -> bf time $ bx time@.
