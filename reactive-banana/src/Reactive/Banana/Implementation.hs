    Setting up an event network
------------------------------------------------------------------------------}
{-$Prepare

    After having read all about 'Event's and 'Behavior's,
    you want to hook things up to an existing event-based framework,
    like @wxHaskell@ or @Gtk2Hs@.
    How do you do that?

    To do that, you have to use the 'Prepare' monad.
    The typical setup looks like this:
    
> main = do
>   ... -- other initialization
>
>   -- initialize event network
>   prepareEvents $ do
>       -- obtain  Event  from functions that register event handlers
>       emouse    <- fromAddHandler (registerMouseEvent window)
>       ekeyboard <- fromAddHandler (registerKeyEvent window)
>   
>       -- build event network
>       let
>           behavior1 = accumB ...
>           ...
>           event15 = union event13 event14
>   
>       -- animate relevant event occurences
>       reactimate $ fmap print event15
>       reactimate $ fmap drawCircle eventCircle
>
>   ... -- start the GUI framework here
    
    In short, you use 'fromAddHandler' to obtain /input events/;
    the library will register corresponding event handlers
    with your event-based framework.
    
    To animate /output events/, you use the 'reactimate' function.
    
    The whole setup has to be wrapped into a call to 'prepareEvents'.
    
    The 'Prepare' monad is an instance of 'MonadIO',
    so 'IO' is allowed inside. However, you can't pass anything
    of type @Event@ or @Behavior@ outside the 'prepareEvents' call;
    this is intentional.
    (You can probably circumvent this with mutable variables,
    but there is a 99,8% chance that earth will be suspended
    by time-traveling zygohistomorphisms
    if you do that; you have been warned.)
