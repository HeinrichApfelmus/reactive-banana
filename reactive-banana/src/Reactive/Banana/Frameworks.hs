    NetworkDescription, setting up event networks

{-$build

    After having read all about 'Event's and 'Behavior's,
    you want to hook them up to an existing event-based framework,
    like @wxHaskell@ or @Gtk2Hs@.
    How do you do that?

    The module presented here allows you to obtain /input/ events
    from external sources
    and it allows you perform /output/ in reaction to events.
    
    In constrast, the functions from "Reactive.Banana.Model" allow you 
    to express the output events in terms of the input events.
    This expression is called an /event graph/.
    
    An /event network/ is an event graph together with inputs and outputs.
    To build an event network,
    describe the inputs, outputs and event graph in the 'NetworkDescription' monad 
    and use the 'compile' function to obtain an event network from that.

    To /activate/ an event network, use the 'actuate' function.
    The network will register its input event handlers and start producing output.

    A typical setup looks like this:
    
> main = do
>   -- initialize your GUI framework
>   window <- newWindow
>   ...
>
>   -- describe the event network
>   let networkDescription :: forall t. NetworkDescription t ()
>       networkDescription = do
>           -- input: obtain  Event  from functions that register event handlers
>           emouse    <- fromAddHandler $ registerMouseEvent window
>           ekeyboard <- fromAddHandler $ registerKeyEvent window
>           -- input: obtain  Behavior  from changes
>           btext     <- fromChanges    "" $ registerTextChange editBox
>           -- input: obtain  Behavior  from mutable data by polling
>           bdie      <- fromPoll       $ randomRIO (1,6)
>
>           -- express event graph
>           let
>               behavior1 = accumB ...
>               ...
>               event15 = union event13 event14
>   
>           -- output: animate some event occurences
>           reactimate $ fmap print event15
>           reactimate $ fmap drawCircle eventCircle
>
>   -- compile network description into a network
>   network <- compile networkDescription
>   -- register handlers and start producing outputs
>   actuate network

    In short, you use 'fromAddHandler' to obtain /input/ events.
    The library uses this to register event handlers
    with your event-based framework.
    
    To animate /output/ events, use the 'reactimate' function.

{- | Output.
    Execute the 'IO' action whenever the event occurs.
    
    
    Note: If two events occur very close to each other,
    there is no guarantee that the @reactimate@s for one 
    event will have finished before the ones for the next event start executing.
    This does /not/ affect the values of events and behaviors,
    it only means that the @reactimate@ for different events may interleave.
    Fortuantely, this is a very rare occurrence, and only happens if
    
    * you call an event handler from inside 'reactimate',
    
    * or you use concurrency.
    
    In these cases, the @reactimate@s follow the control flow
    of your event-based framework.
