After having read all about 'Event's and 'Behavior's,
you want to hook them up to an existing event-based framework,
like @wxHaskell@ or @Gtk2Hs@.
How do you do that?

The module presented here allows you to

* obtain /input/ events from external sources and to

* perform /output/ in reaction to events.

In constrast, the functions from "Reactive.Banana.Combinators" allow you 
to express the output events in terms of the input events.
This expression is called an /event graph/.

An /event network/ is an event graph together with inputs and outputs.
To build an event network,
describe the inputs, outputs and event graph in the
'Moment' monad 
and use the 'compile' function to obtain an event network from that.

To /activate/ an event network, use the 'actuate' function.
The network will register its input event handlers and start 
producing output.

A typical setup looks like this:
   
> main = do
>   -- initialize your GUI framework
>   window <- newWindow
>   ...
>
>   -- describe the event network
>   let networkDescription :: forall t. Frameworks t => Moment t ()
>       networkDescription = do
>           -- input: obtain  Event  from functions that register event handlers
>           emouse    <- fromAddHandler $ registerMouseEvent window
>           ekeyboard <- fromAddHandler $ registerKeyEvent window
>           -- input: obtain  Behavior  from changes
>           btext     <- fromChanges    "" $ registerTextChange editBox
>           -- input: obtain  Behavior  from mutable data by polling
>           bdie      <- fromPoll       $ randomRIO (1,6)
>
>           -- express event graph
>           let
>               behavior1 = accumB ...
>               ...
>               event15 = union event13 event14
>   
>           -- output: animate some event occurences
>           reactimate $ fmap print event15
>           reactimate $ fmap drawCircle eventCircle
>
>   -- compile network description into a network
>   network <- compile networkDescription
>   -- register handlers and start producing outputs
>   actuate network

In short,

* Use 'fromAddHandler' to obtain /input/ events.
The library uses this to register event handlers with your event-based framework.

* Use 'reactimate' to animate /output/ events.

{- | Output.
Execute the 'IO' action whenever the event occurs.


Note: If two events occur very close to each other,
there is no guarantee that the @reactimate@s for one 
event will have finished before the ones for the next event start executing.
This does /not/ affect the values of events and behaviors,
it only means that the @reactimate@ for different events may interleave.
Fortuantely, this is a very rare occurrence, and only happens if

* you call an event handler from inside 'reactimate',

* or you use concurrency.

In these cases, the @reactimate@s follow the control flow
of your event-based framework.
    
Note: An event network essentially behaves like a single,
huge callback function. The 'IO' action are not run in a separate thread.
The callback function will throw an exception if one of your 'IO' actions
does so as well.
Your event-based framework will have to handle this situation.

-- | Input,
-- obtain an 'Event' from an 'AddHandler'.
--
-- When the event network is actuated,
-- this will register a callback function such that
-- an event will occur whenever the callback function is called.

-- | Input,
-- obtain a 'Behavior' by frequently polling mutable data, like the current time.
--
-- The resulting 'Behavior' will be updated on whenever the event
-- network processes an input event.
--
-- This function is occasionally useful, but
-- the recommended way to obtain 'Behaviors' is by using 'fromChanges'.
-- 
-- Ideally, the argument IO action just polls a mutable variable,
-- it should not perform expensive computations.
-- Neither should its side effects affect the event network significantly.

-- | Output,
-- observe when a 'Behavior' changes.
-- 
-- Strictly speaking, a 'Behavior' denotes a value that
-- varies /continuously/ in time,
-- so there is no well-defined event which indicates when the behavior changes.
-- 
-- Still, for reasons of efficiency, the library provides a way to observe
-- changes when the behavior is a step function, for instance as 
-- created by 'stepper'. There are no formal guarantees,
-- but the idea is that
--
-- > changes (stepper x e) = return (calm e)
--
-- WARNING: The values of the event will not become available
-- until event processing is complete. Use them within 'reactimate'.
-- If you try to access them before that, the program
-- will be thrown into an infinite loop.
